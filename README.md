# Lottery-dApp-using-Hardhat-IPFS-NextJS
This is a decentralized lottery/rafale application using hardhat and will also add IPFS integration for profile pictures and other data if possible. Inspired from freecodecamp lectures. Using hardhat instead of truffle because of its DX.
Might continue development since the testing requirement is too high compared to learning the Blockchain Devving.
